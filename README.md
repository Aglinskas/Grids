Modifiable via parameters inside, the script fits shapes on a grid in random, non-overlapping positions.

Parameters available: 
* Size of the grid (canvas)
* List of different figures to fit on the grid
* Number of repetitions of each shape
* Directory to output the pictures;

_Grids.m_ generates one grid at a time.
_Grids_fullAuto.m_ requires a file called _f_list.mat_ with a list of different grid configurations pre-specified to be available. Generates a bunch a different grids.
